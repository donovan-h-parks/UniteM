1.0.4
- better handling of genomes that fail with Prodigal or HMMER
- make use of previously calculated results for calling genes and identifying marker genes

1.0.3
- fix bug with progress indicator for identifying Pfam and TIGRfam markers

1.0.2
- added numpy as a dependency

1.0.1
- fixed setup.py to include all required packages

1.0.0
- initial release using GTDB-derived marker genes instead of using CheckM

0.1.1
- removed last dependency on biolib

0.1.0
- full migration to Python 3
- improved running of external programs
- more robust parsing of coverage files to work with CoverM
- removed CheckM Python module as a dependency; CheckM program is still a 3rd party dependency
- removed biolib Python module as a dependency
- pep8 formatting
- removed support for BinSanity
- program failure returns code 1
- improved logging, including logging output of external programs

0.0.18
- added biolib as dependency

0.0.17
- improved Python 3 compatibility

0.0.16
- changes to support renamed executables in MetaBAT v2.12.1

0.0.15
- changed interface to 'bin' command to make it clear either BAM files or a coverage file must be provided

0.0.14
- fixed bug with different MetaBAT presets all being written to the same directory
- moved to updated version of GroopM v2 that can accepted a 'jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths' formatted coverage file
- changes percent base pairs in common calculation from (shared/bin1) to (shared/max(bin1, bin2))
- added in table and plots showing base pairs in common between UniteM bins and those from specific binning methods

0.0.13
- fixed bug with directories containing few bins being processed incorrectly

0.0.12
- fixed bug with code to call GroopM v2

0.0.11
- better error handling of binning methods that fail to run to completion

0.0.10
- better error handling for directories missing any valid bins

0.0.9
- added the 'bin' command

0.0.8
- simplified reporting by having a single parameter for setting 
  the weight used for calculating quality

0.0.7
- changed 'consensus' binning so a contig is only removed 
  iff it appears in a consensus of non-matched bins, which
  not includes the highest quality bin as a positive hit
- percentage to remove a contig must also now be strictly
  greater than the specified percentage
- also made changes to the 'consensus' method for adding contigs
- took out merging of bins since it was producing chimeric bins on the CAMI synthetic community
- change default weighting for quality from 5 to 2

0.0.6
- fixed bug with 'greedy' method

0.0.5
- refined 'majority vote' method and renamed to 'consensus'
- 'greedy' method now performed as special case of 'consensus' method to simplify code base
- added option to merge partial bins

0.0.4
- initial implementation of greedy 'majority vote' method

0.0.3
- initial implementation of Markov 'majority vote' method

0.0.2
- initial implementation of greedy method

0.0.1
- initial release
