- changed 'consensus' binning so a contig is only removed 
  iff it appears in a consensus of non-matched bins, which
  not includes the highest quality bin as a positive hit
- percentage to remove a contig must also now be strictly
  greater than the specified percentage
- also made changes to the 'consensus' method for adding contigs

- change default weighting for quality from 5 to 2
