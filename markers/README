Marker set inferred from GTDB R202 species representative genomes using the
script get_gtdb_domain_hmms.py with default values.

The files pfam_ar.lst, pfam_bac.lst, tigr_ar.lst, and tigr_bac.lst contain the
set of Pfam and TIGRfam marker genes used to evaluate the completeness and
contamination of archaeal and bacterial genomes.

The pfam.hmm and tigrfam.hmm contain the HMM models. These file contain HMMs
for the marker genes used to estimate genome quality along with additional 
HMMs require to ensure these marker genes are robustly identified. These 
additional HMMs are require to remove false positive annotations that would
otherwise occur due to the high sequence similarity between certain Pfam
and TIGRfam protein families.
